        <p id=aboutme> My name is Kowser Kassa but I’ve gone by “Koko” since childhood. I am 23 years old and a graduate of the Year Up program. In my life, I have been lucky enough to travel to various places as well as live in a foreign country. I’ve traveled to Germany, London, Canada, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and I lived in Egypt. I hope to begin a career as a continue to travel the world I want to explore as much as I can while encouraging young children of color persue STEM careers. I come from a big family—seven sisters and one brother!—and I believe that made me more of a people person as I have had to learn to get along with various personalities. </p>
